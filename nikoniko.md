## Instructions of use
Please copy the content of this calendar on an file named 'nikoniko.md' in a new branch of your github repository named metrics.
Change the headers of the columns, and write the names of your team members.
Create as many rows as needed (it depends on the length of your sprints).
Each day of the sprint, each member of the groups should commit a change to this file with the feeling on the row of the day and on his column. 

Prior to the scrum retrospective meeting, the scrum master will compute a total sum of the type of faces for the whole spring, for each day, an for each member.

In the retrospective meeting, the team has a discussion about those results.

## Example:

### Sprint 3: L3-Measurement 

| Day           | J. A. Parejo  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Day 1         |    :smiley: (Meaning that I am learning, I like the work and I think I can do it without problems, but with some effort) |
| Day 2         |    - (Meaning that I did no work regarding the PSG2 project)           |
| Day 3         |    :neutral_face:  (Meaning that I feel I had to struggle, but the assigned work was fair and the day productive)          |:fearful:
| Day 4         |    :worried: (Meaning that I feel I have serious difficulties to accomplish the task, or the productivity of my day was awful)           |
| Day 5         |    :fearful:   (I´m desperate, I need help)        |
